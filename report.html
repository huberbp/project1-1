            1. My website serves a fictional Ski-resort called Booze Creek Mountain Resort.

            2. I included the URLs I could find for the images I used as HTML comments.

            3. I have a home page (index.html), about the resort, the slopes, food & drinks, events, and a contact me page. Thats 6 different pages.

            4. I have a header that displays the logo, the name of the resort, and the navagation links.

            5. I have navigation links at the top of my website.

            6. My website supports mobile viewing by combining multiple columns into 1 column in almost all of my slides. Also, I decided besides the
            homepage, to remove the title "Booze Creek Mountain Resort" from the nav bar and to only keep the logo, because it took up too much space. Along
            with this, I decided to turn the top of the page from rows to a column so that the nav-bar would have sufficient space when viewing in mobile.

            7. Background color and fonts are shared throughout the pages. Each page also takes it's css for the nav-bar from the same css file. Page specific
            CSS was placed into a unique file.

            8. All of my alt tags accurately describe the pictures.

            9. All of my pages have the snowflake favicon.

            10. My images are in /images and my CSS code is in /css.

            11. I do not use any of the third party tools.

            12. 

            13. All of my large bodies of text are left-aligned.

            14. My text boxes do not bleed to the edges and have sufficient padding.

            15. I used Helvetica for main page headings, Verdana for sub headings within a page, and Garamond for other smaller text.

            16. I had a form on the "Contact Us" page that gets their information.

            17. On the "Contact Us" page I have 3 links to different social media platforms. This simulates Booze Creek's social media accounts.

            18. I used kebab-case for all my naming.

            19.

            20. My site is stored in a Git repository and I shared it with hcientist.

            21. All of my files are lowercase in kebab-case and only have letters and numbers.

            22. Both http and https version of my site work.

            23. I edited my config file so it runs on port 443 and set up my encryption.

            24. In my config file, when connecting on port 80 it redirects to port 443.

            25. I've been slowly updating my github repo as i've worked on it.

            26. This is the write up!
