                    Booze Creek Resort is a winter vacation destination that caters to all ages. Located in
                    Booze Creek, West Virginia, we have been operating since 1956 and have celebrated more
                    than 60 years in business. Booze Creak Resort has been owned and run by the McKenzie family
                    since it's creation in 1956. During all of our years of operation, the McKenzie family has 
                    always had the same motto, "Fun for the whole Family". Their mission, started over 60 years ago,
                    has always stayed the same, to provide a wholesome and fun experience where families can come
                    and spend quality time, while making quality memories.
